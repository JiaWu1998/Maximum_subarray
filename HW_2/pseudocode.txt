Problem: Given an a list of random numbers, each number represents the price
of stocks at a given day, which is represented by the index of the numbers in 
that array.  

Rule 1: Buy one unit of stock only one time
Rule 2: Sell one stock on a later date
Rule 3: You are allowed to have the knowledge of the prices of stocks in all given days

This program find the pair of buy and sell date that will make the most net 
profit. 

Pseudocode:

Initialize a buy date and sell date in a list
Initialize a current profit int variable
Initialize the list of all stock prices that is ordered by the date of the stocks.

for i = 1 to the length of the list of stock prices:
    for j = i to the length of the list of stock prices:

        calculate a temp profit between pairs of stock prices at i and j

        if the temp profit is greater than the current profit:
            then replace the current profit with the temp profit
            and replace the buy date with i and sell date with j
